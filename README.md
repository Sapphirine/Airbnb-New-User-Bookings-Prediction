# Airbnb-New-User-Bookings-Prediction
Founded in August of 2008, Airbnb is a trusted community marketplace for people to list, discover, and book unique accommodations around the world.   As the numbers of accommodations growing, how can we provide new users with personalized recommendations to help them save time when they do their first booking on Airbnb?  Every users have different preferences. By exploiting and analyzing old users’ personal information and web session records, we can predict which country will a new user most likely choose with his/her basic information.  For this project, we will build a system to make a prediction about the destination country of every new user’s first booking.
